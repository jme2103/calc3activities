          A
          <term>vector</term><idx><h>vector</h><h>definition</h></idx> is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and
          direction.

      If a physical quantity has both magnitude and direction, it is called <em>vectorial</em>. If it has only magnitude, it is called <em>scalar</em>.

            Use your physical intuition to decide which of the following quantites are vectorial and which are scalar.

      Graphically, a vector is represented as a line segment with an 
      arrowhead placed on one end. The magnitude 
      corresponds to its length and the direction corresponds to the direction
      that it points. Algebraically, a vector is represented by an <m>n</m>-tuple
      of numbers, called its components. For example, 
      <m>{\bf v} = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rangle</m> is a vector 
      in <m>n</m>-dimensional space. (N.B. Angled brackets denote a vector,
      whereas round brackets denote a point.) 
    </p>

    <p>
      Graphically, the <em>head</em> of a vector is the end with the arrowhead,
      and the <em>tail</em> is the other end. When drawing a vector in
      Euclidean space, the point at which we place the tail is called the 
      <em>initial point</em>, and the point at which we place the head is called the
      <em>terminal point</em>. If <m>P</m> is the initial point and <m>Q</m> is the
      terminal point, we often write <m>{\bf v} = \overrightarrow{PQ}</m>.

            Suppose that the vector <m>{\bf v} = \langle -1, 0, 5 \rangle</m> is represented
            as an arrow with terminal point <m>Q = (4,-3,0)</m>. What is the initial point <m>P</m> of the arrow?

    <p>
      The position vector of a point <m>P</m> is the vector whose initial point
      is the origin and whose terminal point is <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two vectors are <em>equal</em> if they have the same magnitude and direction. Algebraically, this
      means the two vectors have the same components. Notice that neither the initial nor terminal
      point is mentioned in the definition of equality. So, graphically,
      this means the two vectors are equal if they can be superimposed by a translation.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two operations that can be performed on vectors: addition and scalar
      multiplication. They are defined algebraically as:
      <me>
        {\bf v} + {\bf w} = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle + \langle w_1, w_2, w_3 \rangle = \langle v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, v_3 + w_3 \rangle  
      </me>
      <me>
        c{\bf v} = c \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle = \langle cv_1, cv_2, cv_3 \rangle  
      </me>
