      The fixed vector <m>\vv</m> in the definition is called a
      <em>direction vector</em><idx><h>line</h><h>direction vector</h></idx> for the line. 
      To find an equation for a line through point <m>P</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, observe that
      any vector parallel to <m>\vv</m> will have the form <m>t \vv</m> for some
      scalar <m>t</m>. So, any vector emanating from the point <m>P</m> in a direction
      parallel to the vector <m>\vv</m> will be of the form
      <men>
        \overrightarrow{OP} + t \vv
      </men>
      for some scalar <m>t</m> (where <m>O</m> is the origin).

      The three components of the vector function <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> give what is called a

      Another way to think of a line in 2D is as the set of terminal points of vectors emanating
      from a given point <m>P</m> that are orthogonal to a fixed vector <m>\vn</m>. In <m>\R^3</m>, 
      the same statement gives a way to describe planes.
