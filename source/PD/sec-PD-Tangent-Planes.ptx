    This is an example of one of the core ideas in calculus: if you zoom in enough most functions 
    look like a linear function. The two caveats that we must include are that (1) the function
    is not too crazy (this property is called <em>differentiability</em>) and (2) the behavior
    is only valid in a small neighborhood of the point in question (we say the approximation is
    only valid <em>locally</em>).
  </p>

    The next activity will guide you to correct linearization for a function of two variables.

        Let <m>f(x,y) = 6 - \frac{x^2}{2} - y^2</m> and focus on the point <m>(x_0, y_0) = (2,1)</m>.

        <p>
          On two separate sets of axes, sketch the graphs of the two traces and the tangent vectors to <m>\vr_1'</m> and <m>\vr_2't</m> at the time
          when they pass through the point <m>(2,1,f(2,1))</m>. One set of axes
          represents the plane <m>x = 2</m>, and so its horizontal axis should be labelled <m>y</m>. The other represents the plane <m>y = 1</m>, so
          its horizontal axis should be labelled <m>x</m>.

          The tangent plane to the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(2,1)</m> should contain the two vectors you plotted. Find an equation for this plane.

    We now repeat the above procedure for any function <m>f</m> that is differentiable at the point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>. Consider the two parameterized curves
    <me>
      \vr_1(t) = \lrangle{x_0, t, f(x_0, t)} \qquad \vr_2(u) = \lrangle{u, y_0, f(u, y_0)}.
    </me>
    Both curves are contained in the graph of <m>f</m>, and, when <m>t = y_0</m> and <m>u = x_0</m>, they intersect at the point <m>(x_0, y_0, f(x_0, y_0))</m>. Their derivatives are
    <me>
      \vr_1'(t) = \lrangle{0, 1, f_y(x_0, t)} \qquad \vr_2(t) = \lrangle{1, 0, f_x(t, y_0)}.
    </me>
    Because we are holding one of the variables constant in each case, the last component is the appropriate partial derivative. Finally, both vectors <m>\vr_1'(y_0)</m> and
    <m>\vr_2'(x_0)</m> are tangent of the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x_0, y_0, f(x_0, y_0))</m>, we can define the tangent plane to be the plane containing these two vectors.
    First, we take their cross product
    <me>
      \vr_1'(y_0) \times \vr_2'(x_0) = \det \begin{bmatrix} \vi \amp \vj \amp \vk \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp f_y(x_0, y_0) \\ 1 \amp 0 \amp f_x(x_0, y_0) \end{bmatrix} =  \lrangle{f_x(x_0, y_0), f_y(x_0, y_0), -1}.
    </me>
    Using this the normal vector and <m>(x_0, y_0, f(x_0, y_0))</m> gives the formula below.

    For a function of <m>n</m> variables, the tangent plane is an <m>n</m>-dimensional (affine, linear) subspace <m>\R^{n+1}</m>.
    When <m>n=1</m>, it's a line in <m>\R^2</m>; when <m>n=2</m>, it's a plane in <m>\R^3</m>. In general, we say that it's
    a hyperplane in <m>\R^{n+1}</m>. The equation of the tangent hyperplane to a function <m>w = f(x,y,z)</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> is
