  <p>
    The partial derivatives <m>f_x</m> (and <m>f_y</m>, <m>f_z</m>, <m>f_{x_i}</m>, etc) 
    answer the question, "What is the rate of change of <m>f</m> in the positive <m>x</m>
    (and <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, <m>x_i</m>, etc) direction?" In this section, we will see
    an efficient way to answer this question for any direction in the domain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We start by fixing a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> and a direction, 
    i.e. a unit vector <m>\vu = \lrangle{u_1, u_2}</m>. Then 
    <me>\vr(t) = \lrangle{x_0, y_0} + t\vu = \lrangle{x_0 + u_1t, y_0 + u_2t}</me>
    is a line (parameterized by arc length) that passes through <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> at time
    <m>t = 0</m> in the direction of <m>\vu</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The composition <m>f(\vr(t))</m> is a function <m>\R \to \R</m>. Its derivative at <m>t = 0</m>
    will be the rate of change of <m>f</m> we are looking for. Moreover, the chain gives
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t = 0} f(\vr(t)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) \frac{dx}{dt}\bigg|_{t = 0} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) \frac{dy}{dt}\bigg|_{t = 0}
    </me>
    as the form of the derivative. Lastly, we note that <m>dx/dt = u_1</m> and <m>dy/dt = u_2</m>.
    This expression gives the <dfn>directional derivative</dfn> of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> in
    the direction of <m>\vu</m>

    Just as the gradient of a function of two variables is orthogonal to the level curves of the function, the gradient
