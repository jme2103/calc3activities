    Suppose that you are on a ship at sea. The vector-valued function 
    <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle</m> is your trajectory along the surface of the ocean, 
    and <m>T(x,y)</m> is the temperature at sea level at the location with coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>.
    What is the rate of change of the temperature you feel as you sail along your trajectory?
  </p>

  <p>
    To answer this question, we will start with an approximation. At a certain time <m>t</m>, the
    temperature we experience is <m>T(x(t), y(t))</m>. If we let time increase by a small amount <m>\Delta t</m>,
    then our position coordinates will change by corresponding small amounts <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>.
    We know from single-variable calculus that
    <me>
      \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt} \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{dy}{dt}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    We also know that the small changes in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> create proportionally small changes in temperature. The change in temperature can be approximated
    using the tangent plane.
    <me>
      \Delta T \approx \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \Delta y
    </me>
    Since we are interested in the rate of change of <m>T</m> with respect to <m>t</m>, divide this equation by <m>\Delta t</m> and take
    the limit as <m>\Delta t</m> approaches zero.
    <md>
      <mrow> \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} \amp \approx \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} </mrow>
      <mrow> \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} \amp = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} </mrow>
      <mrow> \frac{d T}{d t} \amp = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \frac{d x}{d t} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \frac{d y}{d t} </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In other words, we have found a formula for the derivative of the composition <m>T(\vr(t))</m>, in terms of the vector-valued
    function <m>\vr(t)</m> (inside function) and multivariable function <m>T(x,y)</m> (outside function).

    Note that the chain rule has the obvious extension to function of <m>f(x,y,z)</m> of three variables composed with 
    a vector-valued function <m>\vr(t) \lrangle{x(t), y(t), z(t)}</m>. In fact, any mutivariable function 
    <m>f:\R^n \to \R</m> can be composed with <m>n</m> different multivariable
    functions <m>u_i : \R^m \to \R</m>. Instead of writing a version of the chain rule for each case, we can write a
    single general version of the chain rule that covers all of these cases. If <m>z = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)</m> and
    <m>x_i = u_i(t_1, \ldots, t_m)</m>, then
    <me>
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial t_j} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_1} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial t_j} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_2} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial t_j} + \cdots + \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_n} \frac{\partial x_n}{\partial t_j}.

    To keep track of all the dependencies among the variables, it's helpful to use a tree diagram. 
    <figure xml:id="F_10_5_tree_1">
      <caption>A tree diagram illustrating dependencies.</caption>

      <image source="images/fig_10_5_tree_1"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>
    To represent the Chain Rule, we label every edge of the diagram with the
    appropriate derivative or partial derivative, as seen at right in <xref ref="F_10_5_tree_1">Figure</xref>. To calculate an overall derivative according to the Chain Rule, we
    construct the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting
    the variables and then add all of these products.
    For example, the
    diagram at right in <xref ref="F_10_5_tree_1">Figure</xref> illustrates the Chain Rule
    <me>
      \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} +
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}.
