  <p>
    When optimizing a function of a single variable, we have several tools at our disposal which are
    straightforward to apply. Fermat's Theorem states that a continuous function will always have a 
    global max or min when considered over a closed and bounded interval. (However, as we saw above it may or may
    may not have a global extrema when the interval is not closed or not bounded.) We also know that the global extrema
    will occur either at critical points (i.e. values of <m>x</m> where <m>f'(x) = 0</m> or <m>f'(x)</m> 
    is undefined) or at the endpoints of the closed interval. Thus we may find the global extrema by
    evaluating <m>f</m> at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval, and then locating
    the largest and smallest values. (This is known as the <em>closed interval method</em>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The same principles apply when locating the global extrema of a function of two variables. However,
    we must extend the notions of <em>closed and bounded interval</em>, <em>endpoint</em>, and <em>critical point</em>
    appropriately to <m>\R^n</m>.

    <title>Closed and Bounded Subsets of <m>\R^n</m></title>
    <p>
      Let <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> be a fixed point in <m>\R^2</m> and let <m>r</m> be a positive real number. We
      will denote the set of all points in <m>\R^2</m> that are within a distance <m>r</m> of <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> by
      <me>
        B_r(x_0,y_0) = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2} \lt r\}.
      </me>
      These sets are called <em>open disks</em> or <em>open balls</em>. Open disks in
      <m>\R^n</m> are defined similarly: <m>B_r(\vx_0) = \{ \vx \in \R^n : |\vx - \vx_0| \lt r \}</m>. A subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R^2</m> is 
      said to be <em>open</em> if for every point <m>(x,y) \in S</m> there exists
      a positive real number <m>r</m> such that <m>B_r(x,y) \subseteq S</m>. A subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R^2</m> is said to be
      <em>closed</em> if its complement is open.
