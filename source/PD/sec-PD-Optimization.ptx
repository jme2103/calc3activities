  <p>
    When optimizing a function of a single variable, we have several tools at our disposal which are
    straightforward to apply. The Extreme Value Theorem states that a continuous function will always have a 
    global max or min when considered over a closed and bounded interval. (However, as we saw above it may or may
    may not have a global extrema when the interval is not closed or not bounded.) We also know that the global extrema
    will occur either at critical points (i.e. values of <m>x</m> where <m>f'(x) = 0</m> or <m>f'(x)</m> 
    is undefined) or at the endpoints of the closed interval. Thus we may find the global extrema by
    evaluating <m>f</m> at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval, and then locating
    the largest and smallest values. (This is known as the <em>closed interval method</em>.)
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a function of two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The function <m>f</m> has a <em>local maximum</em> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that <m>f(x,y) \leq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.  In this situation we say that <m>f(x_0, y_0)</m> is a <em>local maximum
                          value</em>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The function <m>f</m> has a <em>local minimum</em> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that <m>f(x,y) \geq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this situation we say that <m>f(x_0, y_0)</m> is a <em>local minimum value</em>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              An <em>absolute maximum point</em> is a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> for  which <m>f(x,y)\leq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> in the
                        domain of <m>f</m>. The value of <m>f</m> at an absolute maximum point is the <em>maximum value</em> of <m>f</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              An <em>absolute minimum point</em> is a point such that <m>f(x,y) \geq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. The value of <m>f</m> at an absolute minimum point is the <em>minimum value</em> of <m>f</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The same principles apply when locating the global extrema of a function of two variables. However,
    we must extend the notions of <em>closed and bounded interval</em>, <em>endpoint</em>, and <em>critical point</em>
    appropriately to <m>\R^n</m>.

      Let <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> be a fixed point in <m>\R^2</m> and let <m>r</m> be a positive real number. We
      will denote the set of all points in <m>\R^2</m> that are within a distance <m>r</m> of <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> by
      <me>
        B_r(x_0,y_0) = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2} \lt r\}.
      </me>
      These sets are called <em>open disks</em> or <em>open balls</em>. Open disks in
      <m>\R^n</m> are defined similarly: <m>B_r(\vx_0) = \{ \vx \in \R^n : |\vx - \vx_0| \lt r \}</m>. A subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R^2</m> is 
      said to be <em>open</em> if for every point <m>(x,y) \in S</m> there exists
      a positive real number <m>r</m> such that <m>B_r(x,y) \subseteq S</m>. A subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R^2</m> is said to be
      <em>closed</em> if its complement is open.

    <title>Critical Points and The Second Derivative Test</title>

    <p>
      Fermat's Theorem from calculus states that any local extremum of a function
      must occur at a point where the derivative is zero. This helps locate global
      extrema because we know that they must occur either at (a) points with zero
      derivative, (b) endpoints of the closed interval, or (c) points where the
      derivative is undefined.
    </p>

    <p>
      This observation motivates the definition of critical points. A point <m>x_0</m>
      in the domain of <m>f</m> is a <em>critical point</em> if either <m>f'(x_0) = 0</m>
      or <m>f'(x_0)</m> is undefined.

              In this example,

                \nabla f = \langle 2x, 2y \rangle

              In this example,
              <me>
                \nabla f = \langle 2x, -2y \rangle

              Thus, <m>(0,0)</m> is the only critical point of <m>f</m>.
              The graph of <m>f</m> is a hyberbolic paraboloid that makes a saddle shape around the origin,

              The graph of <m>f</m> is a paraboloid that opens in the negative <m>z</m>-direction,

              In this case we will never have <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m>,
              but <m>\nabla f</m> will fail to exist when <m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>.
              This gives us infinitely many critical points <mdash/> all points of the form <m>(0,y)</m> or <m>(x,0)</m>.
              The graph of <m>f</m> has sharp folds along the <m>x</m>-axis or <m>y</m>-axis,
              so we should expect that <m>f</m> is not differentiable at those points.
              The graph of <m>f</m> also indicates that <m>f</m> has an absolute minimum value at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.

              So <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when <m>2(y - 2) = 0</m> and <m>2(x + 1) = 0</m>,
              or at the point <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

              The graph of <m>f</m> is a hyperbolic paraboloid, so we can expect that it has only one critical point
              (at which <m>f</m> has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum value).

      Let's consider what the graph of a function <m>f(x,y)</m> looks like near some critical points <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
      Below is the graph and a contour plot for the function <m>f(x,y) = 10 - (x^2 + y^2)</m> near the critical point <m>(0,0)</m>.
      Notice that <m>(0,0)</m> is a local maximum.

    <p>
      Next, is the graph and a contour plot for the function <m>f(x,y) =  3x^2 + y^2</m> near the critical point <m>(0,0)</m>.
      Notice that it is a local minumum.

      Finally, consider the graph and contour plot for the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2</m> 
      near the critical point <m>(0,0)</m>. Notice that if you travel through the critical point
      in one direction it appears as a local maximum, but in the other direction it appears as 
      a local minimum. We call this a <em>saddle point</em>.

    <p>
      Just as in the single-variable case, not every critical point corresponds to a local extremum. Consider,
      for example, the function <m>f(x) = x^3</m> at the origin. In order, to identify which local extrema
      are maxima, which are minima, and which are neither, we can use the second derivative test. If <m>x_0</m> 
      is a critical point of the function <m>f</m>, then <m>f''(x_0) \gt 0</m> implies that it's a local minimum,
      <m>f'(x_0) \lt 0</m> implies that it's a local maximum, and <m>f''(x_0) = 0</m> does not provide any additional
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      For functions of two variables, we will use a version of the second deriviative test that takes into account
      all the second derivatives of the function.

    <p>
      Recall, also, that every symmetric matrix is diagonalizable over the real numbers. Let
      <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m> be the eigenvalues of <m>\hess(f)</m>. Also,
      the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Thus, we can write
      <me>
        D = \lambda_1 \lambda_2.
      </me>
      If both eigenvalues are negative or positive, their product will be positive, and we 
      are in the first case. Essentially, we are able to say that the function is concave down
      or concave up when viewed from any direction. If the eigenvalues have different signs,
      their product will be negative, and there will be on direction from which it's concave up
      and one from whic it's concave down.

              To find the critical points,
              we determine the points in the domain of <m>f</m> (<m>x \neq 0</m> and <m>y \neq 0</m>) where
              <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> or <m>\nabla f</m> does not exist.
              Now
              <me>
                \nabla f = \left\langle y-\frac{2}{x^2}, x-\frac{4}{y^2} \right\rangle
              </me>,
              and so <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when
              <md>
                <mrow>y-\frac{2}{x^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x-\frac{4}{y^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
              </md>.
              The first equation tells us that <m>y = \frac{2}{x^2}</m>.
              Substituting into the second equation shows that
              <md>
                <mrow>x - \frac{4}{\left(\frac{2}{x^2}\right)^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x - \frac{4x^4}{4} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x - x^4 \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x(1-x^3) \amp = 0</mrow>
              </md>.
              So <m>x = 0</m> or <m>1-x^3 = 1</m>.
              This gives us <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=1</m>.
              Now <m>x=0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
              so we only consider <m>x=1</m>.
              Then <m>y = \frac{2}{1^2} = 2</m>.
              Thus, the only critical point of <m>f</m> is <m>(1,2)</m>.
              To classify this critical point with the Second Derivative Test,
              we need the second order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.
              Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us
              <me>
                \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \frac{4}{x^3}, \ \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = \frac{8}{y^3}, \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = 1
              </me>.
              Then
              <me>
                D(1,2) = f_{xx}(1,2)f_{yy}(1,2) - \left(f_{xy}(1,2)\right)^2 = (4)(1) - (1)^2 = 3
              </me>.
              That <m>D(1,2) \gt 0</m> and
              <m>f_{xx}(1,2) \gt 0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a relative minimum at <m>(1,2)</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              To find the critical points,

              Now
              <me>
                \nabla f = \langle 3x^2-3y, 3y^2 - 3x \rangle
              </me>,
              and so <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when <m>3x^2-3y = 0</m> and <m>3y^2 - 3x = 0</m>. Solving these equations simultaneously yields the critical points of <m>(0, 0)</m> and <m>(1, 1)</m>.
              To classify these critical points with the Second Derivative Test,
              we need the second order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.
              Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us
              <me>
                \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 6x, \ \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 6y, \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = -3
              </me>.
              Then
              <me>
                D(0, 0) = f_{xx}(0, 0)f_{yy}(0 0) - \left(f_{xy}(0, 0)\right)^2 = (0)(0) - (-3)^2 = -9
              </me>.
              That <m>D(0, 0) \lt 0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a saddle point at <m>(0, 0)</m>.
              Also, 
              <me>
                D(1,1) = f_{xx}(1, 1)f_{yy}(1, 1) - \left(f_{xy}(1, 1)\right)^2 = (6)(6) - (-3)^2 = 36 - 9 = 27
              </me>.
              Since <m>D(1, 1) \gt  0</m>   and

    <title>Optimization on Closed and Bounded Domains</title>

    <p>
      Just as in the 1D case, to find the absolute extrema of a differentiable function
      on a closed and bounded set, it suffices to search for critical points in the
      interior of the set and use single-variable calculus to find the extrema on the boundary.
      The largest and smallest of these values will the the absolute maximum and minimum of the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for determining the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed and bounded domain.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Step 1:</title>
          <p>
            Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 2:</title>
          <p>
            Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain. Working on the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem to one or more single variable optimization problems. Note that there may be endpoints on portions of the boundary that need to be considered. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 3:</title>
          <p>
            Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 4:</title>
          <p>
            The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step 3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained in Step 3.

      Sometimes it is possible to locate an absolute extremum on a non-closed or non-bounded set. For example, it's easy to see that <m>f(x) = x^2</m>
      the local minumum at <m>x = 0</m> is also an absolute minimum. Just note that <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for 
      <m>x \gt 0</m>. Hence <m>f</m> is always decreasing to the left of the local minimum and always increasing to the right. This means that the local 
      minimum is also an absolute minimum. A similar argument can be made for multivariable functions. If a function has a unique local extremum
      which is either a local maximum or a local minimum, then it is also an absolute extremum.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are attempting to find the extrema of the distance function <m>d(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</m>, it's often easier
      to work with the square of the distance function <me>d^2(x,y) = x^2 + y^2</me>. You can prove that both functions will have the same
      extrema, but the partial derivatives will have a simpler form.

      According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail 
      may not exceed 108 inches, where by “girth” we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our 
      goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that 
      can be sent by mail. We can think of this problem as a constrained optimization problem.
      We wish to optimize the volume of the parcel, but we are constrained by the fac that the
      girth plus the length of the parcel must not exceed 108 inches. The function to be optimized is
      <me>
        f(x,y) = x^2y,
      </me>
      and, assuming that the volume is actually maximized when the sum of the girth and the length 
      is exactly 108 inches, the constraint is <m>4x + y = 108</m>. Another way to think of the 
      constraint is as a contour of the function
      <me>
        g(x,y) = 4x + y.
      </me>
      at the level <m>108</m>. The constraint is shown below in red, along with several contours 
      of <m>f</m>.

      </figure>
      It's clear that the maximum we seek is somewhere between points <m>C</m> and <m>D</m>. Also, the
      maximum is characterized by the constaint and the contours being parallel (i.e. having parallel
      tangent lines). Equivalently, the gradient vectors of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> will be
      parallel at this point. Solving the equation
      <me>
        \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g

      will give us the point where the maximum volume is attained, and this method is called the
      method of Lagrange multipliers.

              Assume the pop can is cylindrical.
              Let <m>r</m> by the radius and <m>h</m> the height of the can.
              The volume <m>V</m> of the can is constant at 355 cc of liquid.
              The radius and height can be any positive numbers as long as the volume is 355.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We want to minimize the surface area <m>A</m> of the can, where
              <me>
                A(r,h) = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
              </me>.
              The volume of the can is <m>V(r,h) = \pi r^2 h</m>, so our constraint is
              <me>
                355 = V(r,h) = \pi r^2 h
              </me>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To solve this constrained optimization problem,
              we need to find the values of <m>\lambda</m>,
              <m>r</m>, and <m>h</m> that satisfy
              <md>
                <mrow>\nabla A \amp = \lambda \nabla V</mrow>
                <mrow>\left\langle 4\pi r + 2\pi h, 2 \pi r \right\rangle \amp = \lambda \left\langle 2\pi rh, \pi r^2 \right\rangle</mrow>
              </md>.
              So we have to solve the equations
              <md>
                <mrow>\pi r^2h \amp = 355</mrow>
                <mrow>4\pi r + 2\pi h \amp = \lambda 2\pi rh</mrow>
                <mrow>2 \pi r \amp = \lambda \pi r^2</mrow>
              </md>.
              Since <m>r \gt 0</m>, these equations simplify to
              <md>
                <mrow>2\pi r^2h \amp = 355</mrow>
                <mrow>2r + h \amp = \lambda rh</mrow>
                <mrow>2 \amp = \lambda r</mrow>
              </md>.
              So
              <men xml:id="eq_LM_example1">
                \lambda = \frac{2}{r} = \frac{2r+h}{rh}
              </men>.
              Now
              <me>
                h = \frac{355}{\pi r^2}
              </me>,
              so equation <xref ref="eq_LM_example1"/> becomes
              <me>
                \frac{2}{r} = \frac{r+h}{rh} = \frac{2\pi r^3+355}{355r}
              </me>.
              Applying some algebra yields
              <md>
                <mrow>\frac{2}{r} \amp = \frac{2\pi r^3+355}{355r}</mrow>
                <mrow>710 \amp = 2\pi r^3 + 355</mrow>
                <mrow>r^3 \amp = \frac{355}{2\pi}</mrow>
                <mrow>r \amp = \sqrt[3]{\frac{355}{2\pi}}</mrow>
                <mrow>r \amp \approx 3.84 \text{ cm } </mrow>
              </md>.
              This makes
              <me>
                h = \frac{355}{\pi r^2} \approx 7.66 \text{ cm }
              </me>
              and
              <me>
                \lambda = \frac{2}{r} \approx 0.52
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To minimize the surface area under the assumptions we have made,
              the radius should be approximately 3.84 cm and the height approximately 7.66 cm.

          To minimize the cost of this crate,

      <solution>
        <p>
          We want to minimize the cost <m>C</m> of the crate.
          Let <m>x</m> be the length,
          <m>y</m> the width, and <m>z</m> the height of the crate.
          The volume <m>V = xyz</m> of the crate is to be 240 cubic feet,
          so <m>x \gt 0</m>, <m>y \gt 0</m>, and <m>z \gt 0</m>.
          The area of the top and bottom of the crate is <m>2xy</m>,
          so the cost of the top of the crate is <m>2xy</m> and the cost of the bottom is <m>3xy</m>.
          The area of the sides of the crate is
          <m>2xz + 2yz</m> and so the cost of the sides is <m>1.5(2xz+2yz)</m>.
          Thus, the total cost of the crate is
          <me>
            C(x,y,z) = 5xy + 3(xz+yz)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The volume of the crate is to be 240 cubic feet, so our constraint is
          <me>
            240 = V(x,y,z) = xyz
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now
          <me>
            \nabla C = \lambda \nabla V
          </me>
          implies
          <me>
            \nabla C = \langle 5y+3z, 5x+3z, 3(x+y) \rangle = \lambda \langle yz, xz, xy \rangle
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we need to solve the system of equations
          <md>
            <mrow>xyz \amp = 240</mrow>
            <mrow>5y+3z \amp = \lambda(yz)</mrow>
            <mrow>5x+3z \amp = \lambda(xz)</mrow>
            <mrow>3(x+y) \amp = \lambda(xy)</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last three equations give us
          <me>
            \lambda = \frac{5}{z} + \frac{3}{y} = \frac{5}{z}+\frac{3}{x} = \frac{3}{x}+\frac{3}{y}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the fact that <m>z = \frac{240}{xy}</m> we have
          <me>
            \frac{xy}{48}+\frac{3}{y} = \frac{xy}{248}+\frac{3}{x} = \frac{3}{y}+\frac{3}{x}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the equation
          <me>
            \frac{xy}{48}+\frac{3}{y} =  \frac{3}{y}+\frac{3}{x}
          </me>
          gives us
          <me>
            y = \frac{144}{x^2}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we substitute into the equation
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{xy}{48}+\frac{3}{x} \amp = \frac{3}{y}+\frac{3}{x}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{xy}{48} \amp = \frac{3}{y}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{3}{x} \amp = \frac{x^2}{48}</mrow>
            <mrow>x^3 \amp = 144</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp = \sqrt[3]{144}</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp \approx 5.24 \text{ ft } </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then
          <me>
            y = \frac{144}{x^2} = \sqrt[3]{144} \approx 5.24 \text{ ft }
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            z = \frac{240}{xy} = \approx 8.74 \text{ ft }
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also,
          <me>
            \lambda = \frac{3}{x}+\frac{3}{y} \approx 1.15
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to minimize the cost of this crate,
          the crate should be a box of approximate dimensions <m>5.24 \times 5.24 \times 8.74</m> feet.
