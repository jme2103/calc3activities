  <title>Parametric Surfaces</title>
  
  <p>
    A parameterization of a curve in space is a vector-valued function <m>\vr(t) = \lrangle{x(t),y(t),z(t)}</m>.
    The curve itself is the set of points traced out by <m>\vr(t)</m> as the parameter ranges over
    some domain. It's helpful to think of in terms of motion: the curve is the path an object takes, while
    a parameterization of the curve is way an object traverses the path.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was helpful in describing lines. From the point of view of linear algebra, a line is 1D (affine) subspace
    of the vector space <m>\R^3</m>. In other words, it's the solution set of a system of two linear equations in three
    variables. Such a description can be quite cumbersome to work with, so we use paramterizations such
    as <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t \vv</m>. Each part of this parameterization has a geometric interpretation: <m>\vr_0</m> is
    some point the line goes through and <m>\vv</m> is a direction vector for the line.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was also helpful to describe curves using a parameterization. For example, a circle of radius 1 in the <m>xy</m>-plane
    is the set of points that solve <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. But this is not the graph of a function, so compute the arc length,
    for example, potentially requires multiple integrals. The same is true of any geometric quantity such as curvature or torsion.
    Instead, it's usually easier to work with a parameterization such as <m>\vr(t) = \lrangle{\cos t, \sin t, 0}</m>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The same is true of surfaces. We want to be able to parametrize a surface in a way that makes it easy to compute
    the quantities we are interested in. Some surfaces, such as planes, are the graphs of functions of two variables, but
    many other surfaces, such as cylinders, spheres, and tori, are not. In this section, we will show how to parameterize
    some surfaces and how to compute their surface area using a parameterization.
  </p>

  <p>
    A curve is a one-dimensional object, so a parameterization requires one parameter. A surface is a two-dimensional object,
    so a parameterization requires two parameters. A vector-valued function <m>\vr(s,t)</m> of two independent parameters
    <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> is a <term>parameterization of a surface <m>S</m></term> if <m>S</m> consists of the terminal points 
    of all vectors of the form
    <me>
      \vr(s,t) = \lrangle{x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t)}
    </me>
    where <m>x = x(s,t)</m>, <m>y = y(s,t)</m>, and <m>z = z(s,t)</m> are functions of two variables. These are called the
    <em>parametric equations</em> for the surface.

  <p>
    Just as the area element for double integrals in <m>\R^2</m> depends on the coordinate 
    system, the area element for surfaces in <m>\R^3</m> depends on the parameterization.
    Consider a parameterization <m>\vr(s,t)</m> of a surface <m>S</m> defined for
    <m>a \leq s \leq b</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m>. As usual, we divide <m>[a,b]</m>
    into <m>m</m> equal subintevals each of length <m>\Delta s = \frac{b - a}{m}</m> and
    endpoints <m>a = s_0 \lt s_1 \lt s_2 \lt \cdots \lt s_m = b</m>. And we divide
    <m>[c,d]</m> into <m>n</m> equal subintevals each of length <m>\Delta t = \frac{d - c}{n}</m> and
    endpoints <m>c = t_0 \lt t_1 \lt t_2 \lt \cdots \lt t_n = d</m>. Each subrectanlge
    will have area <m>\Delta A = \Delta s \Delta t</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The subrectangles <m>[s_{i-1},t_{j-1}] \times [s_i, t_j]</m> all have area <m>\Delta s \Delta t</m>.
    However, the parameterization <m>\vr(s,t)</m> may stretch or shrink these subrectangles. The distortion
    is measured by the derivatives. If we hold <m>t</m> constant, then <m>\vr(s,t)</m> becomes
    a parameterized curve <em>in the surface</em>. The tangent vector to this curve
    <me>
      \vr_s(s,t) = \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial s} = \lrangle{x_s(s,t), y_s(s,t), z_s(s,t)}
    </me>
    will be tangent to the surface. Similarly, if we hold <m>s</m> constant, then <m>\vr(s,t)</m> becomes
    a parameterized curve in the surface and the tangent vector
    <me>
      \vr_t(s,t) = \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial t} = \lrangle{x_t(s,t), y_t(s,t), z_t(s,t)}
    </me>
    will be tangent to the surface. These two vectors span the tangent plane to the surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we zoom into the surface at a point enough, it will begin to look like its tangent plane. Using the
    tangent plane approximation, if we increase <m>s</m> by a small amount <m>\Delta s</m>, then
    <m>\vr</m> changes by approximately <m>\vr_s \Delta s</m>. Similarly, if we increase <m>t</m> by a small
    amount <m>\Delta t</m>, then <m>\vr</m> changes by approximately <m>\vr_t \Delta t</m>.
    The rectangle <m>R_{ij} = [s_{i-1},t_{j-1}] \times [s_i, t_j]</m>, which has area <m>\Delta s \Delta t</m> is 
    transform by <m>\vr</m> into approximately the parallelogram <m>S_{ij}</m> spanned by <m>\vr_s \Delta s</m> and
    <m>\vr_t \Delta t</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From vector geometry, we know that the area of a parallelogram spanned by two vectors is the 
    magnitude of their cross product. So, we get that
    <me>
      \Delta S = | (\vr_s \Delta s) \times (\vr_t \Delta t) |   = | \vr_s \times \vr_t | \Delta s \Delta t =  = | \vr_s \times \vr_t | \Delta A.
    </me>
    where the second equality comes from the fact that <m>\Delta s</m> and <m>\Delta t</m> are 
    positive scalars, which, by the properties of the cross product and magnitude, can be moved outside.
    This equation is saying that to approximate the amount of area on the surface <m>\Delta S</m> that corresponds to
    a small rectangle of area <m>\Delta A</m> in the parameter space you should scale it by <m>| \vr_s \times \vr_t |</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approximate will improve as the number of subrectangles increases. We take the limit <m>m,m \to \infty</m> as 
    the number of rectangles goes to infinity to get area element for the surface:
    <me>
      dS = | \vr_s \times \vr_t | dA = | \vr_s \times \vr_t | \, ds \, dt
    </me>
    To find the surface area of <m>\vr(s,t)</m>, defined on a domain <m>D</m>, we integrate the function 
    <m>f(x,y,z) = 1</m> against this area element over the parameter domain
    <md>
      <mrow> \text{Area of surface} \amp = \iint_{\text{surface}} f(x,y,z) dS </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \iint_D f(\vr(s,t)) | \vr_s \times \vr_t | \, dA </mrow>

            Recall that any surface defined by a function
            <m>f = f(x,y)</m> in Cartesian coordinates can be thought of as a surface defined parametrically with parameters <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> by
            <me>
              x(s,t)=s, \ \ \ \ y(s,t) = t, \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ z = f(s,t)
            </me>.
            The surface is then given by the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> with <m>\vr(s,t) = \langle s, t, f(s,t) \rangle</m>.
            In this case we have
            <me>
              \vr_s(s,t) = \langle 1,0,f_s(s,t)\rangle \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \vr_t(s,t) = \langle 0,1,f_t(s,t)\rangle
            </me>.
            So
            <me>
              \lvert \vr_s \times \vr_t \rvert = \lvert \langle -f_s(s,t), -f_t(s,t), 1 \rangle \rvert = \sqrt{f_s(s,t)^2 + f_t(s,t)^2+1}
            </me>,
            and the formula for surface area becomes
            <me>
              \int \int_D \sqrt{\left(f_x(x,y)\right)^2 + \left(f_y(x,y)\right)^2 + 1} \ dA
            </me>.

            Using the formula from part (a) we have that the surface area is

              <mrow>\amp = \int_{-2}^2 \int_0^3 \frac{2}{\sqrt{4-x^2}} \, dy \, dx</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \int_{-2}^2 \int_0^3  \frac{2}{\sqrt{4-x^2}}y\biggm|_0^3 \, dx</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 6\int_{-2}^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{4-x^2}} \, dx</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 6 \arcsin{\frac{x}{2}}\biggm|_{-2}^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 6\left(\arcsin(1)-\arcsin(-1)\right)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 6\pi</mrow>
            </md>.

            The cross sections of the surface of this solid are semicircles with radius 2.
            So the surface area of this solid should be <m>2\pi \times 3 = 6\pi</m>.
